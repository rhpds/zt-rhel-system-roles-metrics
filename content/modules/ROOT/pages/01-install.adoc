== Introduction

In this lab there are 4 hosts. Below is a description of them and their
purpose.

|Host |Description
|`+rhel+` |Control node where the metrics system role will run. As well,
Grafana will be installed here.

|`+rhel2+` |RHEL9 host where we will collect metrics from.

|`+rhel3+` |RHEL9 host where we will collect metrics from.

|`+rhel4+` |RHEL9 host where we will collect metrics from.
|===

Initially we will configure the first 3 hosts. After, we will add
`+rhel4+` to the observability system since it is likely you will need
to add additional hosts to your infrastructure well after the initial
installation and configuration has taken place.

Weâ€™ll start by installing RHEL System Roles on `+rhel+`

First, click on the menu tab labelled `+rhel+`. Click this button
link:tab-0[button label="`rhel`"] to switch to the `+rhel+` tab.

Click the `+run+` button to run the following command into the `+rhel+`
terminal.

[source,bash,run]
----
dnf install -y rhel-system-roles
----

The resulting output should look similar to below.

RHEL System Roles are now installed.
