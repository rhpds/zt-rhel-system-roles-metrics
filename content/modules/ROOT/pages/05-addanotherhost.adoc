== Monitor another host by adding it to the inventory

So far we have configured 2 RHEL hosts (`+rhel2+`, `+rhel3+`) to be monitored and have their performance metrics collected by host running Grafana (`+rhel+`). Weâ€™ll now edit the play book to configure and add another host `+rhel4+`. This exercise is useful as you add more and more hosts to your datacenter.

The following configuration file will install PCP on the host `+rhel4+`. As well, it will tell the `+rhel+` Grafana host to monitor `+rhel4+`, in addition to the other hosts. Run this command in the `+rhel+` terminal.

[source,bash,run]
----
tee ~/metrics/inventory.yml << EOF
all:
  children:
    servers:
      hosts:
        rhel2:
        rhel3:
        rhel4:
      vars:
        metrics_retention_days: 7
        metrics_manage_firewall: true
        metrics_manage_selinux: true
    metrics_monitor:
      hosts:
        rhel:
      vars:
        metrics_graph_service: yes
        metrics_query_service: yes
        metrics_retention_days: 7
        metrics_monitored_hosts:  "{{ groups['servers'] }}"
        metrics_manage_firewall: true
        metrics_manage_selinux: true
EOF

You may notice the only change made has been to add `+rhel4+` to this section:

[source,yaml,nocopy]
----
all:
  children:
    servers:
      hosts:
        rhel2:
        rhel3:
        rhel4:
----

You may ask yourself why we did not remove the originally configured hosts or the Grafana configuration. The reason is because RHEL System Roles are based on Ansible. Ansible playbooks are designed to be run multiple times ensuring that the same result is obtained on each target host. Therefore, running the playbook multiple times on the same hosts should obtain the same result on each host.

Run the playbook in the `+rhel+` terminal with the following command to execute the modified playbook.

[source,bash,run]
----
ansible-playbook ~/metrics/metrics.yml -b -i ~/metrics/inventory.yml
----

Now go back to the Grafana dashboard.

Refresh the dashboard page on your browser.

You should be able to see `+rhel4+` has been added and metrics are being
collected.
