== Run a stress test

Letâ€™s run a stress test on `+rhel2+` and `+rhel3+`

Click on this button link:tab-1[button label="`rhel2`"] to switch to the
`+rhel2+` terminal tab.

Run the following command.

[source,bash,run]
----
stress --cpu 16 --io 3 --vm 5 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 60s
----

`+stress+` is a utility for generating artificial loads on cpu, memory,
and disk. You can play around with the `+--cpu+`, `+--io+`, and `+--vm+`
flags to generate different loads. `+--timeout+` specifies the duration
of the test.

Click on this button link:tab-2[button label="`rhel3`"] to switch to the
`+rhel3+` terminal tab.

Run the `+stress+` command as above to generate an artificial load.

[source,bash,run]
----
stress --cpu 16 --io 3 --vm 5 --vm-bytes 128M --timeout 60s
----

When these `+stress+` tests are complete, go back to the Grafana
dashboard and view the performance metrics of the `+rhel2+` and
`+rhel3+` hosts. The dashboards might take a minute or two to update.

You can also experiment with the dash board scales and intervals.
