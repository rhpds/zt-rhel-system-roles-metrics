== Configure the playbook

Let’s create a directory to store our playbook as well as a
sub-directory to store playbook variables.

[source,bash,run]
----
mkdir -p metrics
----

Next, we’ll create an inventory file for the playbook. This inventory
file contains a list of hosts and the role they will be assigned when
the playbook is run as well as all the variables required to be set.
These include things like PCP retention settings, and the ports that we
will open to enable PCP and Grafana.

[!NOTE] A `+README+` document for RHEL System Roles is available in the
`+/usr/share/doc/rhel-system-roles/metrics+` directory, including
example playbooks.

[source,bash,run]
----
tee -a ~/metrics/inventory.yml << EOF
all:
  children:
    servers:
      hosts:
        rhel2:
        rhel3:
      vars:
        firewall:
          - service: pmcd
            state: enabled
        metrics_retention_days: 7
    metrics_monitor:
      hosts:
        rhel:
      vars:
        firewall:
          - service: grafana
            state: enabled
        metrics_graph_service: yes
        metrics_query_service: yes
        metrics_retention_days: 7
        metrics_monitored_hosts:  "{{ groups['servers'] }}"
EOF
----

We’ll configure PCP to retain 7 days worth of performance data for the
`+servers+` specified in the inventory.

.servers retention
image::../assets/serversretention.png[servers retention]

The following variables designate the `+rhel+` host to run the
`+metrics_graph_service+` and `+metrics_query_service+` which are the
Grafana and Redis software packages respectively.

.metrics monitor
image::../assets/metricsmonitor.png[metrics monitor]

== Create the main playbook

Create the main playbook file. Notice that we are using both the
`+metrics+` and `+firewall+` system roles. Earlier, we specified ports
to open for the `+pmcd+` and `+grafana+` services in the inventory.

[source,bash,run]
----
tee -a ~/metrics/metrics.yml << EOF
- name: Use metrics system role to configure PCP metrics recording
  hosts: servers
  roles:
    - redhat.rhel_system_roles.metrics
    - redhat.rhel_system_roles.firewall

- name: Use metrics system role to configure Grafana
  hosts: metrics_monitor
  roles:
    - redhat.rhel_system_roles.metrics
    - redhat.rhel_system_roles.firewall
EOF
----

== Run the playbook

Now run the playbook.

[source,bash,run]
----
cd metrics
ansible-playbook metrics.yml -b -i inventory.yml
----

.metrics completed
