== Configure the playbook

In this section, we will configure the playbook to collect metrics from the hosts in the inventory (on hosts `+rhel2+`, `+rhel3+`), and configure Grafana to display the metrics on the `+rhel+` system.

== Create the inventory file and configure Grafana

[%collapsible]
====
Let’s create a directory to store our playbook as well as a
sub-directory to store playbook variables.

[source,bash,run]
----
mkdir -p metrics
----

Next, we’ll create an inventory file for the playbook. This inventory
file contains a list of hosts and the role they will be assigned when
the playbook is run as well as all the variables required to be set.
These include things like PCP retention settings, and the ports that we
will open to enable PCP and Grafana.

NOTE: A `+README+` document for RHEL System Roles is available in the
`+/usr/share/doc/rhel-system-roles/metrics+` directory, including
example playbooks.


[source,bash,run]
----
tee -a ~/metrics/inventory.yml << EOF
all:
  children:
    servers:
      hosts:
        rhel2:
        rhel3:
      vars:
        firewall:
          - service: pmcd
            state: enabled
        metrics_retention_days: 7
    metrics_monitor:
      hosts:
        rhel:
      vars:
        metrics_graph_service: yes
        metrics_query_service: yes
        metrics_retention_days: 7
        metrics_monitored_hosts:  "{{ groups['servers'] }}"
        metrics_manage_firewall: true
        metrics_manage_selinux: true
EOF
----

We’ll configure PCP to retain 7 days worth of performance data for the
`+servers+` specified in the inventory.

.servers retention

The following variables designate the `+rhel+` host to run the
`+metrics_graph_service+` and `+metrics_query_service+` which are the
Grafana and Redis software packages respectively.

.metrics monitor

== Create the main playbook

[%collapsible]
====
Create the main playbook file. Notice that we are using both the
`+metrics+` and `+firewall+` system roles. Earlier, we specified ports
to open for the `+pmcd+` and `+grafana+` services in the inventory.

[source,bash,run]
----
tee -a ~/metrics/metrics.yml << EOF
- name: Use metrics system role to configure PCP metrics recording
  hosts: servers
  remote_user: root
  roles:
    - redhat.rhel_system_roles.metrics

- name: Use metrics system role to configure Grafana
  hosts: metrics_monitor
  remote_user: root
  roles:
    - redhat.rhel_system_roles.metrics
EOF

== Run the playbook

[%collapsible]
====
Now run the playbook. It will take a few minutes to complete.

[source,bash,run]
----
cd metrics
ansible-playbook metrics.yml -b -i inventory.yml
----

.metrics completed
